# MessWithDevs
A cruel tool to wind up people that leave their computers unattended.

First things first, I accept no responsibility if this get you fired, ruins a
group project, or anything!

Having said that, there are measures in place to make sure that this doesn't ruin
any lives.

To mess with them, install with

  `pip install MessWithDevs`

and run the following command to break their code:

  `mwd _file_name_`

and the following to reverse it:

  `mwd _file_name_ -r`.

If for some reason this doesn't reverse the damage (it should), run:

  `mwd _file_name_ -rf`

to revert to the original.
